## üí≠ About this repository :
Hi everyone, the repository you are viewing right now shares my IDE (Visual Studio Code) settings. All you have to do is download the file named "settings.json" and copy its contents to your file with the same name on your IDE. To do this, go to the command palette by executing the command CTRL+SHIFT+P and search for ‚Äúsettings.json‚Äù then press the ENTER key. Finally, delete all the lines of code present in the file and copy those present in the file present in the repository that I provided you. This will overwrite your old settings and apply my own. Thank you for your interest and now enjoy !
